# Deep-Dive-Final
Deep Dive is the product of my exploration of Google's Deep Dream program. It is built off the existing Deep Dream code by Alex Mordvintsev, and uses the Inception trained model.Each code cell must be run in order. You can either run them all by hand, by pressing the play button on the top left corner of each code cell, or you may press ctrl+f9 to run them all.
